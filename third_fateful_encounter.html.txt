<p>Wait a minute...  Is that HIM!  The one with the beanie?  Let's take a look!</p>

<p>"Unidentifiable unknown being scream squeal"  To your greatest Horror, it was not Waldo.  It's your ex, <strong>Crusty Ol'Sweeper</strong>  What are they doing here?  You ask your old soulmate about your missing mom's uncle nephew cousin god grandmother niece.  They didn't respond.  Rather, they did a devious smirk.</p>

<p> Heh.  You will never find your mom's uncle nephew cousin god grandmother niece! </p>

<p>I hate it when you leave, but I love to see you go...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>WHaT THe!?! Crusty Ol'Sweeper just spun away!  They must've done something sinister to Waldo!  Vamonos!  We gotta follow THEM!
